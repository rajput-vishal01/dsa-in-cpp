# Supreme 3.0-DSA Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my journey through the **Supreme 3.0** course by **CodeHelp (a.k.a Love Babbar)**. This course focuses on mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.

## About the Course

Supreme 3.0 is a comprehensive course designed to:

- Strengthen your understanding of core programming concepts.
- Equip you with advanced DSA techniques.
- Prepare you for coding interviews and competitive programming challenges.

### ðŸ“Œ Note

> All course modules which are marked as **In Progress**, indicates that I have completed watching the lecture videos for each topic. However, I still have pending assignments and doubt sessions for these modules.  
>
> My current goal is to **eliminate my fear of DSA** and build enough confidence to **attempt placement-level questions effectively**.  
>
> With the placement season approaching, I have prioritized completing the conceptual parts of the course first, ensuring that I can understand and apply the core ideas during technical interviews and coding rounds.  
>
>I will now begin the revision and assignment-solving phase, during which I will >revisit all modules to gain a deeper understanding of the topics and complete any backlogs along the way.
