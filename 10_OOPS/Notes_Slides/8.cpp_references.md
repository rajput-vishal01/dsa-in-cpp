# C++ Concepts and Topics

## 1. Local vs Global Variables

### Local Variables
Local variables are declared inside a function or block and can only be accessed within that specific scope. They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits. Since local variables have limited scope, they help prevent unintended interference from other parts of the program.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void display() {
    int localVar = 10; // Local variable
    std::cout << "Local Variable: " << localVar << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    display();
    // std::cout << localVar; // Error: localVar is not accessible here
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, `localVar` is only accessible within the `display` function.

### Global Variables
Global variables are declared outside all functions, making them accessible to any function within the program. They are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program ends. Although global variables provide convenience, they can lead to issues if multiple functions modify them unexpectedly.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int globalVar = 20; // Global variable

void display() {
    std::cout << "Global Variable: " << globalVar << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    display();
    globalVar += 5; // Modifying global variable
    std::cout << "Modified Global Variable: " << globalVar << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, `globalVar` is accessible and modifiable in both `display` and `main` functions.

## 2. Memory Layout of a Program
A C++ program's memory layout consists of several segments, each with a specific purpose:

1. **Code Segment**: Contains the compiled machine code of the program.
2. **Data Segment**:
   - **Initialized Data**: Stores global and static variables that are initialized with non-zero values before the program starts.
   - **Uninitialized Data (BSS)**: Stores global and static variables that are initialized to zero or are uninitialized.
3. **Heap**: Used for dynamic memory allocation. Memory allocated with `new` or `malloc` resides here.
4. **Stack**: Used for local variables and function call management. When a function is called, its local variables are pushed onto the stack, and they are popped off when the function returns.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int globalVar;           // Uninitialized Data (BSS)
int initializedVar = 10; // Initialized Data

int main() {
    int localVar = 5;     // Stack
    int* dynamicVar = new int(20); // Heap

    std::cout << "Initialized Variable: " << initializedVar << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Dynamic Variable: " << *dynamicVar << std::endl;
    delete dynamicVar; // Freeing heap memory
    return 0;
}
```
Here, `globalVar` is stored in the uninitialized data segment, `initializedVar` is in the initialized data segment, `localVar` is on the stack, and `dynamicVar` points to memory allocated on the heap.

---

## 3. Const Keyword, Initialization List & Macros

### Const Keyword
The `const` keyword is used to define variables whose value cannot be changed after initialization. It ensures that the variable is read-only, providing safety against accidental modification.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    const int num = 10;
    // num = 20; // Error: Cannot modify a const variable
    std::cout << "Const Variable: " << num << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, attempting to modify `num` would result in a compilation error because it is declared as `const`.

### Initialization List
Initialization lists are used in constructors to initialize member variables before the constructor body is executed. This approach is more efficient, especially for `const` or reference members that must be initialized at the time of their creation.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
    int a;
public:
    MyClass(int x) : a(x) { // Initialization list
        std::cout << "Initialized Value: " << a << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj(10);
    return 0;
}
```
Here, the member variable `a` is initialized using an initialization list.

### Macros
Macros are preprocessor directives that define constants or create function-like expressions. They are processed by the preprocessor before compilation begins.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define PI 3.14159
#define AREA(radius) (PI * radius * radius)

int main() {
    std::cout << "Area: " << AREA(5) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, `PI` is a macro that represents a constant value, and `AREA` is a macro that calculates the area of a circle.

---

## 4. Static Keyword in Class
The `static` keyword is used to declare class members that are shared among all instances of the class. Unlike regular members, `static` members are not tied to a specific object but belong to the class itself.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    static int count; // Static member declaration
    MyClass() { count++; }
};

int MyClass::count = 0; // Static member definition

int main() {
    MyClass obj1, obj2;
    std::cout << "Object Count: " << MyClass::count << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Here, `count` is a static member shared by all instances of `MyClass`. Every time an object is created, `count` is incremented.

---

## 5. Shallow vs Deep Copy

### Shallow Copy
A shallow copy creates a new object and copies the values of the member variables as they are. If the member variable is a pointer, only the pointer is copied, not the object it points to. This can lead to issues when both objects try to manage the same memory.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    int* data;
    MyClass(int val) {
        data = new int(val);
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        delete data;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(10);
    MyClass obj2 = obj1; // Shallow copy
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, `obj2` is a shallow copy of `obj1`, meaning both objects share the same memory location for `data`, leading to potential issues when `obj1` or `obj2` is destroyed.

### Deep Copy
A deep copy duplicates the entire object, including dynamically allocated memory, ensuring that each object manages its own copy of the data.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    int* data;
    MyClass(int val) {
        data = new int(val);
    }
    MyClass(const MyClass& obj) { // Deep copy constructor
        data = new int(*obj.data);
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        delete data;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(10);
    MyClass obj2 = obj1; // Deep copy
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, `obj2` is a deep copy of `obj1`, meaning it has its own separate memory allocation for `data`.

## 6. Can Constructor Be Made Private?

Yes, a constructor can be made private in C++. This is useful in scenarios where you want to control the creation of objects, such as in the Singleton design pattern.

When a constructor is private, objects of the class cannot be created directly from outside the class. Instead, you typically provide a public static method to create and return an instance.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;
    Singleton() {} // Private constructor

public:
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (instance == nullptr) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
};

Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;

int main() {
    Singleton* obj1 = Singleton::getInstance();
    Singleton* obj2 = Singleton::getInstance();

    if (obj1 == obj2) {
        std::cout << "Both instances are the same." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `Singleton` class ensures that only one instance of the class can be created.

---

## 7. Friend Keyword in C++

The `friend` keyword in C++ allows a function or another class to access private and protected members of a class. This is useful when two or more classes need to work closely together.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
private:
    int data;
public:
    MyClass(int val) : data(val) {}
    friend void display(const MyClass& obj); // Friend function declaration
};

void display(const MyClass& obj) {
    std::cout << "Data: " << obj.data << std::endl; // Accessing private member
}

int main() {
    MyClass obj(10);
    display(obj);
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `display` function is a friend of `MyClass`, allowing it to access the private member `data`.

---

## 8. Virtual Constructor vs Virtual Destructor

### Virtual Destructor
In C++, destructors can be declared as `virtual`. This ensures that when an object is deleted through a base class pointer, the derived class's destructor is called, preventing memory leaks.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() { std::cout << "Base Destructor" << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() { std::cout << "Derived Destructor" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    delete obj; // Calls Derived destructor first, then Base destructor
    return 0;
}
```
Here, the destructor of `Derived` is called first, followed by the destructor of `Base`, ensuring proper cleanup.

### Virtual Constructor
C++ does not support virtual constructors directly. However, a common workaround is to use a virtual function that returns a pointer to a newly created object of the derived class. This approach is known as the Virtual Constructor Idiom.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    virtual Base* clone() const = 0; // Pure virtual function
    virtual void display() const = 0;
    virtual ~Base() {}
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived* clone() const override { return new Derived(*this); }
    void display() const override { std::cout << "Derived Class" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj1 = new Derived();
    Base* obj2 = obj1->clone();
    obj2->display();
    delete obj1;
    delete obj2;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `clone` function acts as a virtual constructor, creating a new object of the derived class.

## 9. Inline Functions

Inline functions are functions that are expanded in line when they are called. This reduces the function call overhead by inserting the complete function code at each call site. The `inline` keyword is used to suggest the compiler to make a function inline.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Square: " << square(5) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the `square` function is expanded inline at the call site, potentially improving performance by eliminating the function call overhead.

**Note:** The compiler may ignore the `inline` suggestion for complex functions.
